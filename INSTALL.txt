This is the INSTALL file for the odepack distribution.

This package uses OASIS to generate its build system. See section OASIS for
full information. 

Dependencies
============

In order to compile this package, you will need:
* ocaml for all, doc API
* findlib

Installing
==========

2. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -configure'
3. Run 'ocaml setup.ml -build'

OASIS
=====

OASIS is a program that generates a setup.ml file using a simple '_oasis'
configuration file. The generated setup only depends on the standard OCaml
installation: no additional library is required.

(* OASIS_STOP *)

Non-OCaml dependencies
======================

This is a binding to ODEPACK which must be downloaded from
http://netlib.sandia.gov/odepack/ and unpacked in src/fortran/.
If wget is installed on your system, you can just execute

  make odepack

Since ODEPACK is written in FORTRAN, you will also need a FORTRAN
compiler.  The configure script (see setup.ml) tries to detect several
of them.  If the one you possess is not listed, please send the author
of this library the name and required options for your compiler.
